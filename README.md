# Intra-Inter View Interaction Network for Light Field Image Super-Resolution
This repository contains official pytorch implementation of Intra-Inter View Interaction Network for Light Field Image Super-Resolution in TMM 2021, by Gaosheng Liu, Huanjing Yue, Jiamin Wu, and Jingyu Yang. [TMM 2021 LF-IINet](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9599365)
## Dataset
We use the processed data by [LF-DFnet](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9286855), including EPFL, HCInew, HCIold, INRIA and STFgantry datasets for training and testing. Please download the dataset in the official repository of [LF-DFnet](https://github.com/YingqianWang/LF-DFnet).
## Results
We share the SR LF images generated by our LF-IINet on all the 5 datasets for 2x and 4x SR, which are avaliable at [Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1lBA3zC76bqp1m51pbIXC2w) (key:8tbv). 
## Code
### Dependencies
* Ubuntu 18.04
* Python 3.6
* Pyorch 1.3.1 + torchvision 0.4.2 + cuda 92
* Matlab
### Prepare Training and Test Data
* To generate the training data, please first download the five datasets and run:
  ```matlab
  GenerateTrainingData.m
* To generate the test data, run:
  ```matlab
  GenerateTestData.m
### Train
* Run:
  ```python
  python train.py
### Test
* Run:
  ```python
  python test.py
### Visual Results
* To merge the Y, Cb, Cr channels, run:
  ```matlab
  GenerateResultImages.m
